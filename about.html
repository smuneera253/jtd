            <h5>The transition from annual strategy to actionable steps is marked by our
                commitement to OKRs. In the last week of each quarter, Program Owners craft
                Objectives and Key Results for the forthcoming quarter, drawing directly from the
                annual strategy. This systematic approach ensures our goals are specific, measurable,
                and aligned across the organization, driving focus and clarity.nts that improve</h5>

            <h2>Annual Strategy</h2>
            <h5> Our annual strategy formulation is an exercise of precision and foresight,
                employing Richard Rumelt's Strategy Template in a dedicated workshop. This process begins at the
                organizationallevel, setting a strategic framework that each Program Owner then adapts to develop
                a tailored strategy for their respective programs, ensuring all efforts are in harmony
                with our grand vision.

                to advance our quarterly objectives. Adopting best practices like weekly one-on-ones and scrum
                ceremonies, we ensure a smooth, agile journey towards our strategic goals, ironing out any obstacles
                along the way for seamless progress. </h5>
